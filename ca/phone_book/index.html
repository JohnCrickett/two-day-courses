<h3>Exercise 3: Phone Book, part III</h3>

Your task is to use the sample solution for exercise 2 and now
add some new requirements. You may choose to work on one or 
many of these extra requirements:

<ul>
<li> make sure that your phonebook can handle millions
of entries.
<li> make sure you can search for names as well as numbers
<li> use gprof and valgrind to measure your program.
<li> step through all your code using a gdb and "taste" 
     on every line of code.
<li> make sure that all numbers are "reachable" (avoid
numbers that are prefixes of other numbers, eg 9113456 
together with 911 should be avoided)
</ul>

<p>

Once again - remember to peek at what the other teams do and focus
on the educational value of the exercise. (We are not aiming to
sell this phone book... yet).
