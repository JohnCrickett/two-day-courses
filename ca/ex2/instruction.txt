Exercise 2: Phone Book, part II

Use the sample solution of exercise 1 as your starting point. 

This exercise comprises the following tasks:

a) Make the client responsible for all memory handling

b) Use gcov to observe code coverage 

c) Make sure that attempt to add a number already in the phone book
   fails (duplicate name is ok)

Extra:

d) Make the phone book searchable

e) You must be able to unit test all behavior, in particular the
   printing. 

Bonus:

f) When adding a number, make sure that all numbers are "reachable"
   (avoid numbers that are prefixes of other numbers, eg 9113456
   together with 911 should be avoided)

Once again - remember to peek at what the other teams do and focus
on the educational value of the exercise. (We are not aiming to
sell this phone book... yet).
