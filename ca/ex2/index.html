<h3>Exercise 2: Phone Book, part II</h3>

Use the sample solution of exercise 1 as your starting point. 
This exercise comprises the following tasks:
<ul>
<li> Make the client responsible for all memory handling
<li> Use gcov to observe code coverage
<li> Make sure that attempt to add a number already in the phone book fails (duplicate name is ok)
<li> Make the phone book searchable
<li> You must be able to unit test all behaviour, in particular the printing
</ul>

<p>

Once again - remember to peek at what the other teams do and focus
on the educational value of the exercise. (We are not aiming to
sell this phone book... yet).
