<h3>Exercise 1: Phone Book</h3>

Your task is to create a very simple phone book module that contains 
names and numbers. It must be possible to add and remove entries in
the phone book. You should also be able to print the phone book entries
to the console.

<p>

This seems like a very trivial task. No points is given for finishing
this exercise as quick as possible. Instead try to explore alternative
designs and discuss with your partner and others. Use this exercise as
a catalyst for good discussions about what is good and what is not so
good when working with interfaces and implementation. Peek at what the
other teams are doing, ask Jon for suggestions, etc. Think about what
you can contribute to the class by demonstrating different techniques
and discuss pros and cons.

<p>

When working with this exercise you must use a Makefile and you
should provide proper unit tests and also write a demo application
actually using the phone book. Please name the files like this:

<pre>
phone_book.h
phone_book.c
phone_book_test.c
phone_book_demo.c
Makefile
</pre>
