* Python Foundation, a two day course for professional programmers

This is a two day course in Python programming aimed at professional
programmers. The course material provided here is indended to be used
by _teachers_ of the language, but individual learners might find some
of this useful as well. 

The course assume the students already know some Python, but that they
feel a need to establish a solid understanding of the language to
further develop their skills.

There is an upcoming part II of this course (we will call it Python
Advanced), so we are trying to be selective on how much is being
covered in this part of the course.
