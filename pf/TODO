Here are some TODO issues:

- fix missing numbers in the numgen usage example in the slides

- add a suggestion for a detailed course agenda

- add slides for some of the things that is demonstrated directly in
  the interpreter during the course.

- consider what we can take out of this course and move into a similar
  two day Python Advanced course.
