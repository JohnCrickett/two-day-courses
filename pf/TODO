Here are some TODO issues:

- fix missing numbers in the numgen usage example in the slides

- add model answers for yatzy and isbn

- add more model answers for numgen, eg a structured, a functional,
  and an object oriented solution.

- add a suggestion for a detailed course agenda

- add slides for some of the things that is demonstrated directly in
  the interpreter during the course.

- consider what we can take out of this course and move into a similar
  two day Python Advanced course.
