Here are some TODO issues:

- fix missing numbers in the numgen usage example in the slides

- add a suggestion for a detailed course agenda

- add slides for some of the things that are demonstrated directly in
  the interpreter during the course.

- consider what we can take out of this course and move into a similar
  two day Python Advanced course.

- fix the markup on the README so that it renders nicely on github

- fix cyber-dojo isbn instruction ("if that is" -> "if the string is")

- fix cyber-dojo yatzy instruction (new line before "If the roll")
