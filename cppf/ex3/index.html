<h3>Exercise 3: Recently Used List</h3>

<h4>1. Write a somewhat reusable container in C++</h4>

This is a type of container that might be useful for a GUI menu
where you want to show the most recently edited files.
<p>
Write a container <code>recently_used_list</code> in
namespace <code>mylib</code> where you can add strings, and when
iterating over the elements in the list there should be no duplicates,
and the first element should be the most recently added string, the
next should be the next most recently added string, and so on. If the
container has a max_size, the oldest item should just drop off the
list.
<p>
Here is an example of how such a container might be used:
<pre>
...
mylib::recently_used_list rul(4);
assert(rul.size() == 0);
rul.push_back("foo");
rul.push_back("bar");
rul.push_back("gaz");
assert(rul.size() == 3);
assert(rul[0] == "gaz");
assert(rul[1] == "bar");
assert(rul[2] == "foo");
rul.push_back("bar");
assert(rul.size() == 3);
assert(rul[0] == "bar");
assert(rul[1] == "gaz");
assert(rul[2] == "foo");
rul.push_back("faz");
assert(rul.size() == 4);
assert(rul[0] == "faz");
assert(rul[1] == "bar");
assert(rul[2] == "gaz");
assert(rul[3] == "foo");
...
</pre>
<p>
Important: Work together with your group and try to create a decent
interface and implementation of such a container. Make sure you add
some proper unit tests. Use this opportunity also to discuss good file
organization, nice implementation techniques, C++ idioms and
programming style.
