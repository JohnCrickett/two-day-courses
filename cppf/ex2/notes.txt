Some copyright issues might need to be addressed here. The formulas
for julian day number calculations (see to_day_number() and to_ymd())
are ripped from the boost date time library but it seems to be such a
well known calculation so I'm not sure if it is a copyright issue that
needs to be mentioned (btw, where did boost get their formulas from?).
The calculation is also described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day.
